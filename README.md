## Project Description
Our project is an RPG with a combat and economy system. There are waves of enemies for the character to fight, dealing out melee and range attack. As time passes, the enemies become progressively harder to kill, and the character accumulates money in their bank account. The character can also deposit and withdraw money from the bank to buy different items from merchants. All of the features combine to create an entertaining story for the player.
